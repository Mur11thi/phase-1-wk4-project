## Description
It is a project that is a website based on the award winning series *"Breaking Bad"* . The website fetches Data from the Breaking Bad's public API when the user clicks on the *"GET QUOTE"* button.For every individual quote that is generated  a like button and a comment section is generated as well;which helps the user to like the post and leave a remark about the quote if they would wish to.It is important to note that each time the *"GET QUOTE"* button
is clicked, a new quote is generated below the preceding one and that means if the user has clicked on the button repetitively,multiple quotes will appear;to reset and have no quotes, the user can just refresh the webpage by clicking on the *refresh* icon or by pressing key combination of *ctrl + r* on windows and *command + r* on macbook.
